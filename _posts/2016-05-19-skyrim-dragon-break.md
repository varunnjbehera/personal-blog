The Elder Scrolls series is known for its rich lore and expansive universe. One of the most intriguing aspects of this world is the concept of a "Dragon Break," a phenomenon where time becomes non-linear and multiple conflicting events occur simultaneously. In this blog, we will explore the possibility that Skyrim's Civil War, a central conflict in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, could lead to another Dragon Break.

# 1. Understanding Dragon Breaks:

A Dragon Break is a rare and mysterious event in the Elder Scrolls universe, where time becomes fractured and multiple timelines emerge. This can result in different outcomes of events happening simultaneously and even the merging of these outcomes later on. The most famous Dragon Break, known as the "Warp in the West," occurred in The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall and led to the unification of several kingdoms under one banner.

# 2. The Civil War in Skyrim:

Skyrim's Civil War is a conflict between the Imperial Legion, who seek to maintain control over the province, and the Stormcloak Rebellion, who fight for Skyrim's independence. The player's choices and actions throughout the game can have a significant impact on the outcome of this war.

# 3. Factors Supporting a Dragon Break:

There are several factors that suggest the Civil War could result in a Dragon Break:

### a) Player Choice: 
The player's decisions can lead to vastly different outcomes for the Civil War, and reconciling these different timelines could result in a Dragon Break.

### b) The Last Dragonborn: 
The player character is prophesied to play a pivotal role in the events of Skyrim. Their involvement in the Civil War could be significant enough to cause a fracture in time.

### c) Thalmor Involvement: 
The Thalmor, a faction from the Aldmeri Dominion, have a vested interest in prolonging the Civil War, as it weakens both the Empire and Skyrim. Their manipulation of events could contribute to a Dragon Break.

### d) The Elder Scrolls: 
These ancient artifacts have been known to play a role in Dragon Breaks. With one being central to the main questline of Skyrim, it could potentially be involved in causing another break.

# 4. Implications of a Dragon Break:

If the Civil War were to result in a Dragon Break, it would have significant implications for the future of Tamriel. It could lead to an unpredictable outcome for the war, with both sides potentially claiming victory or defeat simultaneously. Additionally, it could pave the way for new threats or alliances to emerge in the wake of the fractured timelines.

# Conclusion:

While it is impossible to predict with certainty whether Skyrim's Civil War will result in another Dragon Break, there are several factors that suggest it is a possibility. Such an event would have far-reaching consequences for the world of Tamriel and would certainly make for an interesting twist in the already complex narrative of The Elder Scrolls series.
