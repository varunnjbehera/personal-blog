# Placement Sentiment Analysis

![](/data/images/nistpd/nist2.jpg)

## Fear based sentiment bias?
This is a simple MLP based sentiment analysis model for placement department of NIST. It has been trained on the feedback of more than 300 students. The data itself is very skewed, as ratings don't match the negative comments. This begs to question whether students fear the placement cell of NIST.

Following are thoughts of some students:

>More exams such as cocubes test might help.English speaking enhancement classes might help. And also, most important thing, preparing us for GDs, and other personal interviews can do a great job.

>Not good or productive at all.
Face classes might help us clear the aptitude round but if we don't have proper domain knowledge we'll be eliminated at furthur rounds.
So it'll be better if you guys start helping us prepare for GATE rather than aptitude test.
And don't make the class so long that we won't have enough time for our own activities. It might not be important for you but very important for us.

>BCSI classes are the best thing regarding placement. 
But C programing has nothing to do
in my future. Because No core company demands for it.
